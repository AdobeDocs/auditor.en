# Test reference{#test-reference}

This reference provides more information about the tests Auditor performs.

**Current test rubric version:** 1.0.5

Each test is weighted. Your test score is equal to the assigned weight. If you pass a test with a weight of five, you receive five points.

* 0: Alerts you of issues you should be aware of, but that don't affect your score. 
* 1: Recommends an optimization. No impact on data accuracy. 
* 2: Failing this test means you won't have access to the latest features and fixes in the Experience Cloud. 
* 3: Tests for efficiency and whether the implementation follows best practices. 
* 4: Failure means you may be collecting unreliable data. 
* 5: Failure means you may see data loss.

Tests are pass/fail. They test for compliance or non-compliance with the test conditions, so there are no partial scores for partial compliance. For example, if the test checks for the latest version of an Adobe solution and you're only one version behind, you get the same score as if you're five versions back. The most recent versions include performance improvements and bug fixes, so it's recommended to be on the most recent version.

It is **highly recommended** that you fix any level 4 or 5 results.

It is **recommended** that you fix any level 1 to 3 results.
